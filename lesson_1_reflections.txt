How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I was able to higlight differences, didn't have to check every simgle line... otherwise it would have been easy to just oerlook the error (small typo, 1 letter)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    Learn from past mistakes
    Reflect on earlier solutions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I only save on logical changes, not ending up with unusable code / middle of process
    OTOH, manual... might forget!!!

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google Docs is a document authoring sw, focus on individual files
    Git, and version control is thinking is systems, in relationships... clearly better

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Great tools!
    Log: rough overview of history (based on commnts)
    Diff: analyse / compare specific changes + stat!!!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I'll always know, I can revert to earlier states step by step... much more confident about changing things, without fear of braking, or making irreversible changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm only doing little coding (no coding), yet learning to code (python, R)... will try to use from very beginning
    What I'm most interested though: any application for Excel???
