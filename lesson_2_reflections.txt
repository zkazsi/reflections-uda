What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
      Need to do to create baseline, let git know to start tracking
      What happens: git base files created, tracking initialized... but no commit yet (even if called initial commit)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
      Is inbetween them, prepare / define files to be committed to repository
